### UPRO
UPRO is a leveraged ETF that promises 3x daily returns
of S\&P 500. Details: http://etf.com/UPRO

### Non-purpose of this repository
Be of any financial advice. Don't buy UPRO if you cannot stomach 100% losses.
It can literally go to zero in a single day - from the fund's prospectus:

```
> For example, because the Fund includes a multiplier of three times
> (3x) the Index, a single day movement in the Index approaching 33%
> at any point in the day could result in the total loss of an
> investorâ€™s investment if that movement is contrary to the investment
> objective of the Fund, even if the Index subsequently moves in
> an opposite direction, eliminating all or a portion of the earlier
> movement. 
```

### Purpose of this repository
See what has really happened to UPRO between June 2009
and April 2019 - how well it has been tracking it's target,
what's the deviation from the target and how can one predict
future deviation.
